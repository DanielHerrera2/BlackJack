# Coding game Black Jack
The card playing game we all know and love but in coding form coded in java for Object Orientation reasons
> Coding Game Black Jack 3 ( labled that due to the amount of attempts made of making something complie )
Black Jack where we start the user off with 100 dollars and two cards with a set number of values, 
> Kings,Queens,Jacks, are valued at 10 points and the other amount of cards are valued by the face value 
All players(if more than one) are given two cards to begin then are able to chose between two options either a hit or a stand
> The hit function gives the user another card at random
While the player is able to get another card, if the amount of points reach over 21 then the player busts and loses the round
> The stand function lets the player keep what ever hand they have and take the chances of winning or losing
The objective of the game is to be able to beat the dealers hand 
If you win you win the round and gain a little bit of money and if you lose you lose your money
Just like the real game play at your own risk
