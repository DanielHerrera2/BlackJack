# Black Jack 
# Over View
Finished with the whole project just working on the diagrams currently in the hands of the other Daniel. Code has complied and the requirments are filled for the most part. Hoping I am able to transfer it to github right
> Still a work in progress
# Issue
- problem with gettting the diagrams on github
- issue with the interface of github and how to work it
- no other bigger issue
# Resolutoin 
- fixed all the code and now runs smoothly 
- working till the clock to finish diagrams 
- all features required now installed properly 
# Notes
There are still some on going issues with how github works it was almsot like a maze with how complicated it was to use it. 
Project came out better than expected.
